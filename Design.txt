/* Code */

1. We re-used CQRS-Journey source code (tag V1-pseudo-prod)
  Infrastructure Projects
    Infrastructure

2. Repository Pattern is ignored for now, using simply Service instead.

/* Design */

1. We assume only one Rental Provider.

2. We simplify User/Customer handling to a single CustomerName for now.

3. We assume max rent per day on any car is 9999.99.

4. We assume UK Car Number Plate to be varchar(10).

5. We assume extending renting period only goes forward, not backwards,
   and it could have different price due to discount or flux.
